## It’s-a me, Tiago! 👋

With **20+ years of experience** and **60+ projects shipped**, my passion for tech began in childhood. My career includes key roles at Microsoft 💻, co-founding Hive Solutions 🐝, and leading development at Tynker 💡, where I helped create products for over **100 million students** 🎓 and contributed to its **$200 million acquisition by BYJU’s** 💼. I work across frontend, backend, mobile apps 📱, and machine learning 🤖, always adapting and refining my skills to solve new challenges.
