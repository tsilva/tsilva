## Hello, it’s-a me, Tiago! 👋

With **20+ years of experience** and **60+ projects shipped**, my passion for tech began in early childhood, playing around with a [Sinclair ZX Spectrum](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0EfycbDhiw). My career includes key roles at [Microsoft](https://cv.tsilva.eu/#-microsoft) 💻, co-founding [Hive Solutions](https://cv.tsilva.eu/#-hive-solutions) 🐝, and leading development at [Tynker](https://cv.tsilva.eu/#-tynker) 💡, where I helped create products for over **100 million students across 150,000+ schools** 🏫 and contributed to its **[$200 million acquisition by BYJU’s](https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/16/byjus-acquires-coding-platform-tynker-for-200-million-in-us-expansion-push/)** 💼. I work across frontend, backend, mobile apps 📱, and machine learning 🤖, always adapting and refining my skills to solve new challenges.
