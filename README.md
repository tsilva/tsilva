## Itâ€™s-a me, Tiago! ðŸ‘‹

With 20+ years of experience and 60+ projects shipped, my passion for tech began in childhood. My career includes key roles at Microsoft, co-founding Hive Solutions, and leading development at Tynker, where I helped create products for over 100 million students and contributed to its $200 million acquisition by BYJUâ€™s. I work across frontend, backend, mobile apps, and machine learning, always adapting and refining my skills to solve new challenges.
